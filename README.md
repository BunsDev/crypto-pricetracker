Check it out at http://sndvll.github.io/pricetracker

#### wat is it?
App that tracks prices of various crypto assets and calculates total asset value in different fiat currencies. 
Just a playground to create some cool components and Angular Material like stuff from scratch.

### Highlights
A custom dynamic dialog engine created from scratch, that can insert any component on a given position on the page.
Inspired by Angular CDK/Material Overlay/Dialog. 
For usage look at the toast and modal components, and for implementation look in `src/app/core/dialog`

#### Note
The Icon library is recreated from https://github.com/michaelbazos/angular-feather üî• 
(Which did not support Angular 12 at the moment of creation)
